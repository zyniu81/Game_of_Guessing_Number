# Guessing Game

This is a simple guessing game between the computer and the player. The computer generates a random integer between 1 and 100, and prompts the player to guess the number. If the player's guess is too small, the function prints "Too small!". If the player's guess is too big, the function prints "Too big!". If the player's guess is correct, the function prints "You win!" and terminates the game. If the player's input is not a number, the function prints "It's not a number!". If the player interrupts the game, the function prints "Interrupted by the player" and terminates the game.
